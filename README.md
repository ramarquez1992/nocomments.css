# nocomments.css

I don't enjoy seeing the comments on most websites.
So I turned them off. You can too.
Start by downloading [`nocomments.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richard92m/nocomments.css/master/nocomments.css).

## Firefox
1. Find your Firefox profile: in Firefox, choose **Help > Troubleshooting Information**
1. Under **Application Basics**, choose **Show Folder**
1. Open the `chrome/` folder (create it if it does not exist)
1. Copy `nocomments.css` to `chrome/` as `userContent.css`
1. Restart Firefox
